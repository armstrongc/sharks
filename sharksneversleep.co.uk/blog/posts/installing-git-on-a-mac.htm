<p>First, you'll need 'mac ports' installed (which you may already have), and you'll then need to install the git client itself. Mac ports is a command line utility for installing other command line utilities. The git client will give you access to all the commands you need to run.</p>

<h3>Install MAC Develeloper Tools (Xcode)</h3>
<p>Before you install mac ports, you'll need the mac developer tools. It's a hefty download at 1GB. Get it here: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/</a></p>

<h3>Install MAC Ports</h3>
<p>Once you have the dev tool, then get mac ports here: <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php" target="_blank">http://www.macports.org/install.php</a></p>
<p>You'll need one of the ".pkg" installers listed on the page (first paragraph), once you've worked out which version of OSX you're running.</p>

<h3>Install Git</h3>
<p>When that's all done, you can install the git client using mac ports.</p>
<p>Open a terminal and enter the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&gt; sudo port install git-core</pre>

<h3>Generate SSH Key</h3>
<p>You'll need to generate an SSH key that you'll install inside github. This'll identify your machine with Github and let you access it without having to enter a password.</p>
<p>This is what you need to do (in terminal)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">ssh-keygen
[enter passphrase]
&gt; ssh-add id_rsa</pre>

<p>(May get error here: "can't open a connection to your authentication agent", if so</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&gt;   ssh-agent /bin/bash</pre>

<p>then</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"> &gt; ssh-add</pre>

<p>You'll see something like this: 'Identity added: /root/.ssh/id_rsa (/root/.ssh/id_rsa'</p>
<p>then</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&gt; vim ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</pre>

<h3>Connecting to Github</h3>
<p>Add the public key to your Github account, <a href="https://github.com/account" target="_blank">https://github.com/account</a>.</p>
<p>It should be in Account Setting > SSH Keys</p>
<p>Then</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&gt; ssh -vT git@github.com</pre>
<p>to verify that we can authenticate</p>
