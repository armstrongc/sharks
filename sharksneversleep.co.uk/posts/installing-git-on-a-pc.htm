<h3>Generate SSH Keys</h3>
<p>You'll need to generate an SSH key that you'll install inside github. This'll identify your machine with Github and let you access it without having to enter a password.</p>
<p>Run puttygen located in PUTTY folder (might be in the C:\Program Files\Putty folder) C:\Program Files\Putty\puttygen</p>
<p>In PuTTY Key Generator, select 'SSH-2 RSA' from Parameters on bottom and click 'Generate'</p>
<p>Save private key (*.ppk file) and public key (as .txt) for future use and copy the public SSH key.</p>

<h3>Connecting to Github</h3>
<p>Add the public key to your Github account, <a href="https://github.com/account" target="_blank">https://github.com/account</a>.</p>
<p>It should be in Account Setting > SSH Keys</p>
<p>Double click on your .ppk file that you saved earlier.</p>
