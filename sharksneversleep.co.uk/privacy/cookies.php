            <p>Sharks Never Sleep websites use "cookies".</p>
            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a small data file stored by your web browser on your computer. It allows us to recognise your computer by associating the identification numbers in the cookie with other customer information you have provided to us.</p>
            <p>That customer information is stored on our secured database. We use cookies to keep track of what you have in your basket and to remember you when you return to our site. They can also tell us which website you came to us from.</p>
            <h3>Types of cookies we use</h3>
            <p>There are two types of cookie that may be used during your visit to the Sharks Never Sleep website:</p>

            <p>Persistent cookies remain on your browser until they expire automatically after a set time period, unless you delete them yourself.</p>
            <h3>Third party cookies</h3>
